# Stored Procedures Arguments

In T-SQL stored procedures, arguments act as dynamic variables which can directly impact the execution process. You can think of it as giving a command, _"Here's the specific item, please perform the assigned task on it"_. 

The 'item' could be a data set, and the 'task' could be an operation such as sorting, filtering, or any other data manipulation directive. 

These arguments offer flexibility and precision, as they allow the stored procedure to adapt its functionality according to the specific requirements defined by the inputs provided.

Example:

```sql

CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserByID 
    @UserID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Users 
    WHERE UserID = @UserID;
END;

```
In this case, @UserID is the argument that influences the execution of the stored procedure. When you want to use this stored procedure, you would call it and pass in the ID of the user you're interested in, like so:
```sql
EXEC GetUserByID @UserID = 123;
```
In this example, 123 is the specific user ID that you're asking the stored procedure to use in its operation. The stored procedure then uses this ID to select the user's details from the Users table. If you wanted to get details for a different user, you would simply pass in a different ID when calling the stored procedure.
