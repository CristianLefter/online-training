## Starting with WHY

>*Motto*: Having a reason to learn about something is crucial to really learning it. 
>Knowing the topic's **"why"** can provide this meaning and make class more interesting and worthwhile.  
>The "why" of data is **competitive advantage** and a lot more.

It is commonly stated that **"every company is a data company"** due to the importance of data and analytics in the modern corporate world. This implies that companies of all sizes and types can benefit from collecting, storing, and analyzing data in order to make educated decisions and accomplish their objectives.

Several sorts of analytics can be used by businesses to acquire insights from their data:
- **Descriptive analytics**  
This type of analytics entails examining previously acquired data and summarizing it in a way that facilitates comprehension of what has occurred in the past. This could involve the creation of reports, charts, and graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.
- **Diagnostic analytics**  
This type of analytics entails delving deeper into the data to determine the underlying reasons of particular outcomes or events. This can assist organizations in identifying problems or improvement opportunities.  
Utilizing data and statistical models, this sort of analytics predicts future outcomes or occurrences. This can aid organizations in planning for the future and making decisions based on probabilities.
- **Prescriptive analytics**  
This type of analytics uses data and advanced analytics techniques to not only anticipate what may occur, but also to recommend actions that can be taken to attain a desired outcome.

### Instead of a conclusion (for this segment)
One of the most important reasons why businesses require databases is to store and manage the data utilized for these types of analytics. A database is a structured collection of electronically stored data that can be accessed, updated, and queried with relative ease. By keeping data in a database, businesses can analyze and acquire insights from their data more readily.
