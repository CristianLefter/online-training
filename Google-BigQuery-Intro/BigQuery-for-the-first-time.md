# BigQuery for the first time
This module is dedicated to getting started with Google BigQuery.
We can begin exploring BigQuery in minutes by using the free usage tierÂ **sandbox**.

## Enable BigQuery
- We need a Google Account first. If we do not have one we can create one here:   
[![Button Create Account](https://img.shields.io/badge/create-google%20account-blue)](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp)  
- Next, we will sign up for a [Google Cloud Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/) and create or use an existing project.  
[![Button Create GP Account](https://img.shields.io/badge/create-GCP%20account-blue)](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Finally we can use the BigQuery sandbox by creating a new project
