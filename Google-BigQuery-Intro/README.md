# Google BigQuery - Introduction

This repository comprises the online textbook for the Google BigQuery - Introduction course.
## Google BigQuery overview

Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, cloud-based data warehouse solution that enables lightning-fast SQL queries against huge and complicated datasets by leveraging Google's infrastructure processing power. It is a serverless Platform as a Service (PaaS) that supports ANSI SQL querying and can manage structured and semistructured data.

BigQuery is built to manage high volume and high concurrency at petabyte scale, making it an excellent option for enterprises that need to process a vast deal of data. It allows users to utilize SQL to examine data saved in Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, and Google Cloud Bigtable.

BigQuery enables users to construct tables and load data in a number of ways, including by uploading a file, importing data from Google Cloud Storage or Google Drive, streaming data in real-time, or utilizing the BigQuery API to insert data. Once data is in BigQuery, users may generate reports and dashboards using a range of visualization tools, such as Google Data Studio and Google Sheets, or link to business intelligence tools such as Looker and Tableau to do more complex analysis.
