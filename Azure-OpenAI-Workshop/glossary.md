# Glossary

* deployment
* **embedding** is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar.
* **epoch** - In the context of machine learning and particularly in neural network training, the term epoch represents a fundamental concept. An epoch refers to one complete pass of the entire training dataset through the learning algorithm. In other words, when all the data samples have been exposed to the neural network for learning patterns, one epoch is said to be completed.
* **fine-tuning** - retrains an existing Large Language Model using example data, resulting in a new "custom" Large Language Model that has been optimized using the provided examples.
* model
* prompt
* **prompt engineering** - is a technique that involves designing prompts for natural language processing models. This process improves accuracy and relevancy in responses, optimizing the performance of the model
* Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) 
* **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** - improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance by retrieving data from external sources and incorporating it into a prompt. RAG allows businesses to achieve customized solutions while maintaining data relevance and optimizing costs.
* **temperature** - Controls randomness. Lowering the temperature means that the model produces more repetitive and deterministic responses. Increasing the temperature results in more unexpected or creative responses. 
* **top probabilities (Top P)** - Similar to temperature, this controls randomness but uses a different method. Lowering Top P narrows the modelâ€™s token selection to likelier tokens.
