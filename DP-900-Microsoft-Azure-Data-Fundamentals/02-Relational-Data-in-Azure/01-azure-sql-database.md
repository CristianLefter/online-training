# **01 - Azure SQL Database**

## **ðŸ“˜ Overview**
Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service in the **Microsoft Azure ecosystem**, offering scalability, security, and performance for modern applications. To understand Azure SQL Database, we first need to explore **relational data** and database design principles.

## **1. What is Relational Data?**
Relational data is **structured data** stored in tables with predefined schemas, relationships, and constraints. It follows a **relational model**, enabling:
- **Data Integrity** through primary and foreign keys.
- **Efficient Queries** using SQL.
- **ACID Transactions** ensuring data consistency.

### **Key Concepts in Relational Databases**
#### **a) Normalization**
- The process of **structuring data** to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
- Uses different **normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.)**.
- **Example:** Instead of storing customer and order details in one table, they are split into `Customers` and `Orders` tables with a **foreign key** relationship.

#### **b) OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**
- Optimized for **fast, real-time transactions**.
- Common in applications requiring **frequent inserts, updates, and deletes**.
- **Example:** E-commerce applications handling customer orders.

#### **c) OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**
- Designed for **complex queries and reporting**.
- Used in **data warehouses and analytics workloads**.
- **Example:** Generating sales reports by region from aggregated data.

## **2. Azure SQL Family**
Azure provides different SQL database solutions depending on workload needs, management requirements, and scalability options.

### **a) SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS)**
- **Full control** over SQL Server with customizable settings.
- Requires manual **patching, backups, and high availability configuration**.
- Best suited for **lift-and-shift** migrations from on-premises SQL Server.

### **b) Azure SQL Database (PaaS)**
- Fully managed, **automated backups, patching, and scaling**.
- Ideal for **modern cloud applications** that require elastic scalability.
- Supports **serverless and provisioned compute** models.
- **Built-in AI-driven performance tuning and security features**.

### **c) Azure SQL Managed Instance (PaaS Hybrid)**
- Offers **full SQL Server compatibility** in a managed environment.
- Supports **cross-database queries, linked servers, and SQL Agent**.
- Best for **migrating existing SQL Server workloads** with minimal changes.
