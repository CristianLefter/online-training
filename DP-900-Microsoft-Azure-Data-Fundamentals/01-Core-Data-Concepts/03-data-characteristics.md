# **03 - Data Characteristics**

## **ðŸ“˜ Overview**
Data possesses various characteristics that define how it is stored, processed, and utilized. Understanding these characteristics helps in choosing the right storage, processing, and analytics solutions in Azure.

---

## **1. Key Data Characteristics**

### **a) Volume**
- Refers to the **size of data** being processed or stored.
- Large-scale data requires **Big Data solutions** such as **Azure Data Lake Storage and Synapse Analytics**.
- **Example:** Terabytes of IoT sensor data generated daily.

### **b) Velocity**
- The **speed at which data is generated and processed**.
- **Streaming data** needs real-time processing using **Azure Stream Analytics**.
- **Example:** Financial transactions requiring instant fraud detection.

### **c) Variety**
- Represents **different data formats** (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
- Supports **relational, NoSQL, binary, and multimedia data types**.
- **Example:** A mix of SQL database records, JSON logs, and image files.

### **d) Veracity**
- Refers to the **trustworthiness and accuracy** of data.
- Data cleansing and validation techniques improve **data quality**.
- **Example:** Ensuring medical data is accurate before AI-based diagnosis.

### **e) Value**
- The **business or analytical importance** of data.
- Extracting insights from data enables **decision-making and automation**.
- **Example:** Customer behavior analysis to optimize marketing strategies.

### **f) Accessibility**
- Defines how **easily data can be accessed** based on permissions and storage solutions.
- Implementing **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** ensures secure access in **Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB**.
- **Example:** Employee records accessible only to HR personnel.

### **g) Persistence**
- Describes whether data is **temporary or permanently stored**.
- **Cold storage (e.g., Azure Archive Storage)** vs. **hot storage (e.g., Azure SQL Database)**.
- **Example:** Transaction logs retained for compliance while cache data is temporary.

### **h) Scalability**
- The ability to **handle increasing amounts of data** efficiently.
- **Azure Cosmos DB** provides horizontal scaling for **global-scale applications**.
- **Example:** A retail website scaling to support Black Friday traffic.

### **i) Opaqueness (Opaque Data)**
- Data that **cannot be easily interpreted** without specialized tools.
- Often applies to **binary formats like images, videos, or encrypted files**.
- **Example:** A ZIP archive stored in Azure Blob Storage without metadata describing its contents.

### **j) Latency**
- The time delay in **retrieving or processing data**.
- **Azure SQL Managed Instance** reduces query latency for **transactional applications**.
- **Example:** A real-time stock market dashboard requiring low-latency data access.
