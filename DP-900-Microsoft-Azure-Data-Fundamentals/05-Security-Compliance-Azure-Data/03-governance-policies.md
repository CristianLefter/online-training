## 1. What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the set of **policies, processes, and technologies** that ensure data is used responsibly, securely, and in compliance with regulations. It involves:

- **Data Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory standards.
- **Data Quality**: Maintaining accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Managing data from creation to archiving or deletion.
- **Access Control and Accountability**: Defining ownership and responsibility for data assets.

Effective data governance helps organizations **reduce risk, improve decision-making, and ensure regulatory compliance**.

## 2. Azure Governance Tools and Policies

Azure provides a range of governance tools to enforce policies, track compliance, and manage resources efficiently.

### **2.1. Azure Policy**
Azure Policy helps organizations enforce governance rules across resources.

- **Definition Types**:
  - **Built-in Policies**: Predefined compliance rules (e.g., requiring encryption).
  - **Custom Policies**: User-defined rules tailored to business needs.
- **Policy Assignments**:
  - Can be applied at **Management Group, Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource levels**.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Enforcing **tagging rules** for resources.
  - Restricting deployment of **non-compliant resources**.
  - Ensuring **data encryption** is enabled.

### **2.2. Azure Blueprints**
Azure Blueprints help organizations define **repeatable governance models** for resource deployment.

- Combines **Azure Policy, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and resource templates**.
- Ensures consistency across multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, production).
- Useful for **large-scale cloud adoption frameworks**.

### **2.3. Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview)**
Microsoft Purview is a **data governance solution** for managing and tracking data assets.

- **Capabilities**:
  - **Data Cataloging**: Automatically discovers and classifies data.
  - **Lineage Tracking**: Shows how data flows across services.
  - **Access and Security Management**: Integrates with Microsoft Entra ID for access control.
- **Supported Data Sources**:
  - Azure services (Azure SQL, Synapse, Data Lake, etc.).
  - On-premises databases.
  - Multi-cloud environments.

Microsoft Purview helps organizations **improve data transparency and compliance**.

### **2.4. Azure Resource Locks**
Resource locks prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources.

- **Types of Locks**:
  - **Read-Only**: Prevents modifications but allows reading data.
  - **Delete**: Prevents resource deletion while allowing updates.
- Helps enforce governance by protecting essential data resources.

---

### **2.5. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**
Azure provides compliance certifications and tools to meet **industry and legal requirements**.

- **Regulatory Standards Supported**:
  - **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
  - **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

## 3. Best Practices for Data Governance in Azure
- Define **clear ownership** for data assets and enforce access controls.
- Use **Azure Policy** to enforce security and compliance rules.
- Implement **Microsoft Purview** for data classification and tracking.
- Use **Azure Blueprints** for consistent governance across environments.
- Enable **logging and monitoring** to track data access and modifications.
- Apply **resource locks** to prevent accidental deletions.
