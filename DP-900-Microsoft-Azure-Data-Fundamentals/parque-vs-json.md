1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Characteristics:
Format: Text-based, human-readable.
Schema: Schema-less (self-describing), flexible structure.
Storage Efficiency: Less efficient for large-scale data due to redundancy and lack of columnar storage.
Compression: Can be compressed but still larger than Parquet or ORC.
Read Efficiency: Slower for big data because itâ€™s row-based and not optimized for analytics.
Use Cases:
Ideal for APIs, configuration files, and lightweight data exchange.
Used in NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
Good for semi-structured data.
2. Parquet (Apache Parquet)
Characteristics:
Format: Columnar, binary format.
Schema: Strongly typed, schema-based.
Storage Efficiency: Highly compressed; minimizes redundant storage.
Compression: Supports multiple compression algorithms (e.g., Snappy, Gzip).
Read Efficiency: Faster queries for analytics since only required columns are read.
Use Cases:
Best for big data analytics (e.g., used in Spark, Hive, Presto, BigQuery).
Optimized for reading large amounts of structured data with many columns.
Used in cloud storage like AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, and Google Cloud Storage.
3. ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)
Characteristics:
Format: Columnar, binary format (like Parquet).
Schema: Strongly typed, schema-based.
Storage Efficiency: More efficient than Parquet for highly structured data.
Compression: Built-in Zlib, Snappy, and LZO compression.
Read Efficiency: Faster for sequential reads and complex queries.
Use Cases:
Used in Hive and Hadoop ecosystems (better performance for Hive queries).
Works well for ETL pipelines that process large amounts of structured data.
4. Avro (Apache Avro)
Characteristics:
Format: Row-based, binary format.
Schema: Schema-based with evolution support.
Storage Efficiency: More compact than JSON but less than Parquet/ORC.
Compression: Supports Snappy, Deflate, and BZip2.
Read Efficiency: Good for fast writes but not as optimized for analytics.
Use Cases:
Best for streaming and message-based systems (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming).
Ideal for scenarios requiring schema evolution (backward/forward compatibility).
Comparison Table
Feature	JSON (Text)	Parquet (Columnar)	ORC (Columnar)	Avro (Row-based)
Storage	Large	Compact	Highly compact	Compact
Read Speed	Slow (text-based)	Fast for analytics	Faster for Hive	Faster for streaming
Write Speed	Fast	Slower	Slower	Fast
Best For	APIs, NoSQL, Config files	Big Data Analytics, Spark	Hive, Hadoop	Streaming, Kafka
Schema Evolution	No	Yes	Yes	Best support
Final Thoughts
Use JSON for APIs and data exchange but avoid for big data storage.
Use Parquet for columnar storage and analytics.
Use ORC if working with Hive or Hadoop and need better compression.
Use Avro when working with streaming data and schema evolution is required.
